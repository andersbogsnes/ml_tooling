before visualization

# v0.6.1

## Bugfixes
- Data for a class is changed from instance variable to class variable
- Grid search only copies data to workers once and reuses them across grid and folds.
- The Data Class now takes a random seed which it will receive from the BaseClass
- Disabled mem-maping in feature importance
- Added license file to package
- Updated requirements

# v0.6.0

## Features
- Feature importances changed to use permutation instead of built-in for better estimates.

## Bugfixes
- .train_estimator will now reset the result attribute to None, in order to
prevent users from mistakenly assuming the result is from the training
- Fixed bug in lift_score when using dataframes
- Fixed bug when training model and then scoring model
- Fixed bug where users could not save models if no result had been created, as would
happen if the user only called .train_estimator before saving.
