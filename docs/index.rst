Welcome to ML Tooling's documentation!

Get started by :ref:`installing <install>` and head over to :ref:`quickstart`!

There are three main parts to ML Tooling:

* :ref:`baseclass` wraps all the functionality,

* :ref:`transformer` has a number of pandas-compatible scikit-learn `Transformers`_ for use in scikit-learn `Pipelines`_

* :ref:`plotting` has a number of utility plotting functions that can be used standalone


ML Tooling is a convenient wrapper around `Scikit-learn`_ and `Pandas`_
- check the documentation there.


Why?
====
ML Tooling standardises interfaces for training, saving and loading models while also providing a
number of utility functions for everyday tasks such as plotting, comparing results and gridsearching.

ML Tooling was developed at `Alm Brand <https://www.almbrand.dk>`_
